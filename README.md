## Task 0 - Representing data in tabular format
 

Create an application that reads data from the data.txt file and shows it on the console as follows.

	FirstName   LastName
	---------------------
	John        Heart
	Olivia      Peyton
	...
	Walter      Hobbs



### Implementation details
We'll work in a .NET console app.
Use only simplest things implementing this task. Don't use 3-rd party libraries to parse the file. Don't use .NET collections, like List or Stack, or any collection utility methods, like Sort(). Use only arrays and simple types. Feel free to implement all routines on your own, create any classes and utility methods you need, and decompose your project as required =)

Waiting for your commit.
