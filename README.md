## Task 0 - Representing data in tabular format
 

Create an application that reads data from the data.txt file and shows it on the console as follows.

	FirstName   LastName
	---------------------
	John        Heart
	Olivia      Peyton
	...
	Walter      Hobbs



### Implementation details
We'll work in a .NET console app and write code on C#.
Use only simplest things. Don't use 3-rd party libraries. Don't use .NET collections (as List or Stack), or any collection utility methods, like Sort(). Use only arrays and simple types. Feel free to create any routines on your own and keep your project following rapidly changing business requirements =)

Waiting for your commit.
